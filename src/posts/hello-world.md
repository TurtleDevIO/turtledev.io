# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to start sharing my journey in software development with you.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- Web development with modern frameworks
- SvelteKit and Svelte 5
- TypeScript best practices
- Building products and tools

## Code Examples

Here's a simple example of how to use Svelte 5 runes:

```typescript
let count = $state(0);

function increment() {
	count++;
}
```

Pretty cool, right?

## Why This Blog?

I believe in learning by teaching. Writing about what I learn helps me solidify my understanding and hopefully helps others along the way.

Stay tuned for more content!

Smooth coding!
