	introDescription: `I've spent almost two decades in a tech world obsessed with speed and hype. Over the years, I've learned that real progress — and real satisfaction — comes from craftsmanship and consistency.<br><br>Chasing every new tool or trend only leads to shallow understanding and half-finished journeys. Slowing down helps me think clearly, understand deeply, and master the craft.<br><br>Here, I share my knowledge, experience, and reflections on our profession — in my own turtle way.`,
