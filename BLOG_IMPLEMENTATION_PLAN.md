# Blog Implementation Plan

## Project Goal
Build a statically generated personal software development blog to provide quality technical content and drive attention to B2C projects like fastsvelte.dev.

## Design Theme
Implement PaperMod theme aesthetics using DaisyUI components
- **Reference**: https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/
- Clean, minimal design
- Focus on readability and content
- Fast, lightweight

## Architecture Decisions
- **Posts Location**: `src/posts/` directory (more flexible than routes/blog/)
- **Data Loading**: API endpoint + server-side load functions (cleaner separation)
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Shiki with async API (modern, performant)
- **Styling**: DaisyUI + TailwindCSS v4 (PaperMod theme inspiration)
- **Static Generation**: adapter-static with prerendering

- [x] adapter-static configured
- [x] DaisyUI integrated

### âœ… Completed

#### 1.1 Type Definitions & Config
- [x] Created `src/lib/types.ts` with Post interface

---

## Phase 2: Core Blog Functionality

### âœ… Completed

#### 2.1 Build Posts Utility & API
- [x] Created `src/lib/utils/posts.ts` with `getPosts()` function
  - Uses `import.meta.glob('/src/posts/*.md', { eager: true })`
  - Filters by `published: true`
  - Sorts by date descending
- [x] Created `src/routes/api/posts/+server.ts` returning JSON

#### 2.2 Blog Index Page
- [x] Created `src/routes/blog/+page.server.ts` to fetch posts
- [x] Created `src/routes/blog/+page.svelte` with DaisyUI cards
  - Displays title, date, description, categories
  - Links to individual posts

#### 2.3 Individual Post Pages
- [x] Created `src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.ts` with dynamic import
  - Handles 404 errors with `error()` helper
- [x] Created `src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.svelte`
  - Uses Svelte 5 `{@render}` syntax (not deprecated `<svelte:component>`)
  - Renders metadata and markdown content
  - Uses DaisyUI classes

---

## Phase 3: Static Generation & Polish

### âœ… Completed

#### 3.1 Prerendering Configuration
- [x] Created `src/routes/+layout.server.ts` with prerender
- [x] Added `export const prerender = true` to API endpoint
- [x] Created entries function in `src/routes/blog/[slug]/+page.server.ts`
  - Returns all post slugs for static generation
- [x] Tested `npm run build` - successfully generates static site
- [x] Build output verified: index.html, blog.html, blog/hello-world.html

#### 3.2 PaperMod Theme Implementation
- [x] Reviewed PaperMod design at https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/

- âœ… Svelte 5 runes (`$props()` instead of `export let`)
- âœ… TypeScript with strict typing
- âœ… DaisyUI components for UI
- âœ… adapter-static for static generation
- âœ… Shiki v1+ async API for syntax highlighting
- âœ… Proper error handling with SvelteKit's `error()` helper
